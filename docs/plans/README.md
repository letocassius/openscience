# OpenScience × Atlas — improvement sprint (Phase 0: plans)

Branch: `sprint/openscience-atlas-polish`. This directory holds one plan doc per workstream.
Each plan: **Current state · What's broken/missing · Proposed change · Risks · Acceptance criteria**.
Investigation-heavy workstreams (CI, compute, sandboxing) are findings-first.

Nothing irreversible ships without owner sign-off — **sandboxing (10) is design-only pending a go/no-go**.

## Notes at kickoff

- **CI is already green** on `main` — the previously-flaky live-catalog tests were fixed by #91/#92. Workstream 1 is now hardening + coverage on the paths this sprint touches, not firefighting.
- The settings surface already ships `Spend`, `Usage`, `Storage`, `Compute` panels with backing routes — workstream 8 is surfacing/wiring a wallet view, not building from scratch.
- Atlas managed compute runs on **Modal sandboxes** (`atlas agent:run` / `exec:start`) — relevant to both compute (6) and sandboxing (10).
- **Open question for the owner:** whether to make real Atlas-repo changes this sprint (parallel branch + its own PR) or document them for your team, since Atlas is the production backend. Per-workstream plans flag where an Atlas-side change is required.
